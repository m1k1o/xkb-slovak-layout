# Slovak keyboard layout for X.org

Default slovakian keyboard layout in X.org is different from the one in Windows. This is very frustrating for a user who is using slovakian keyboard and wants to switch from Windows to Ubuntu or any other distro using X.org.

Some keys with `AltGr` are different, e.g.
- `AltGr+P` does not produce Apostroph.
- `AltGr` + `AE11` does not produce `dead_diaeresis`.
- etc...

Layout is based on http://kbdlayout.info/KBDSL/, see following picture:

```

Apply new layout.

```bash
setxkbmap sk
```

##Â Alternative installation

Or you can just apply patch.
